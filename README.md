CI/CD Pipeline Setup for a Web Application
Overview
This  process includes containerizing the web application using Docker, configuring a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to automate testing and building, and setting up Continuous Delivery (CD) to deploy the application to a staging environment.
Objectives
1.	Containerize the Web Application
•	Create a Dockerfile.
•	Ensure the container runs the web server on port 8080.
2.	Set Up Continuous Integration
•	Automate testing and building using a CI tool.
3.	Configure Continuous Delivery
•	Automate deployment to a staging environment.
•	Provide rollback capabilities.
________________________________________
1. Containerization
Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile to containerize the Node.js application. The Dockerfile contains instructions to build a Docker image for the application.
Steps:
1.	Base Image: Use the official Node.js image.
2.	Working Directory: Set the working directory inside the container.
3.	Copy Files: Copy the application files into the container.
4.	Install Dependencies: Install the application dependencies.
5.	Expose Port: Expose the port on which the application will run.
6.	Run Command: Specify the command to run the application.
2. Continuous Integration Setup
CI Tool: Jenkins
Jenkins is chosen for its robust plugin ecosystem and ease of use in setting up CI/CD pipelines.
Setup Instructions:
1.	Install Jenkins:
•	Follow the Jenkins installation guide for your operating system.
2.	Install Necessary Plugins:
•	Docker Pipeline Plugin
•	Git Plugin
3.	Create a Jenkins Pipeline:
•	Navigate to Jenkins dashboard.
•	Create a new pipeline job.
•	Configure the pipeline to use a Jenkinsfile from your repository.
Pipeline Configuration:
1.	Source Code Checkout: Configure Jenkins to pull the code from the Git repository.
2.	Build Docker Image: Use Docker to build the application image.
3.	Run Tests: Automate tests using shell commands or scripts.
4.	Push Image to Registry: Push the Docker image to Docker Hub or any other container registry.

3. Continuous Delivery Setup
CD Tool: Jenkins
Use Jenkins for CD to deploy the application to a staging environment.
Setup Instructions:
1.	Staging Environment Setup:
•	Use Docker Compose or a similar tool to set up a staging environment locally or on a cloud provider.
2.	Deployment Pipeline:
•	Add stages to the Jenkins pipeline to handle deployment.
•	Implement rollback logic to revert to the previous version if deployment fails.
Deployment Configuration:
1.	Deploy to Staging:
•	Pull the Docker image from the registry.
•	Run the container in the staging environment.
2.	Verification:
•	Verify the deployment by running a script that checks if the application is accessible and functioning correctly.
3.	Rollback:
•	If verification fails, stop the new container and start the old one to roll back to the previous version.
________________________________________
Example Jenkins Pipeline Stages
1.	Checkout Code:
•	Use the Git plugin to checkout the application code.
2.	Build Docker Image:
•	Build the Docker image using the Docker Pipeline plugin.
3.	Run Tests:
•	Execute any tests to ensure the build is successful.
4.	Push to Docker Registry:
•	Authenticate and push the Docker image to Docker Hub.
5.	Deploy to Staging:
•	Deploy the Docker image to a staging environment.
6.	Verify Deployment:
•	Run a script to verify the deployment.
•	If verification fails, perform rollback actions.

Documentation
Dockerfile
1.	Location: Place the Dockerfile in the root directory of the project.
2.	Usage:
•	Build the Docker image: docker build -t your_image_name .
•	Run the Docker container: docker run -p 8080:8080 your_image_name
Jenkinsfile
1.	Location: Place the Jenkinsfile in the root directory of the project.
2.	Pipeline Configuration:
•	Define the stages as described above.
•	Use environment variables for Docker credentials and container names.
Setting Up Jenkins
1.	Install Jenkins:
•	Follow the official Jenkins installation documentation.
•	Install necessary plugins (Docker Pipeline, Git, etc.).
2.	Create and Configure Pipeline Job:
•	Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
•	Set the pipeline script to use the Jenkinsfile from the repository.
Running the Pipeline
1.	Triggering the Pipeline:
•	The pipeline should trigger on every push to the main branch.
•	You can manually trigger it from the Jenkins dashboard.
2.	Monitoring:
•	Monitor the pipeline execution in the Jenkins dashboard.
•	Check the console output for build logs and deployment status.
3.	Rollback Mechanism:
•	Ensure rollback steps are in place to handle deployment failures.
•	Validate the rollback process by simulating a failed deployment.

Conclusion
By following this documentation, you will set up a robust CI/CD pipeline for the Node.js web application. This setup will automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring efficient and reliable delivery of your application to the staging environment. The use of Docker for containerization and Jenkins for CI/CD provides a scalable and flexible solution for modern application development and deployment.
